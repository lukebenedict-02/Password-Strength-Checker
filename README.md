# Password-Strength-Checker
Description: This contains a file that will recieve your input of a password. It then prints whether the following password is a strong password or not with helpful comments on how to improve it. Note: This program is for educational purposes only.
Do NOT use real passwords.

Installation: This code needs a compiler in order for it to function and run properly. Note: if you are using VS Code then you can do this through the extensions. Once you get the compiler working, in the terminal you can compile it (i.g "g++ -o psc passwordStrengthChecker.cpp") if run in VS Code. Then you can run that executable that you made with "./psc".

Warning and Limitations: This program is just a simple checker based on characters used and how many. It does not check more complex details such as: repetition, real words, patterns, and whether your password is tied to other passwords. Therefore as you recieve your score for your password, you should note these things.

Misuse: Becuase this program doesn't check a full detailed account of your password it can give a false sense of security. Note that this program is for education purposes and should not be used for actual implementation or real life production. Do not change this code to be able to store passwords.
