# Password-Strength-Checker
Description: This contains a file that will recieve your input of a password. It then prints whether the following password is a strong password or not with helpful comments on how to improve it.

Installation: This code needs a compiler in order for it to function and run properly. Note: if you are using VS Code then you can do this through the extensions. Once you get the compiler working, in the terminal you can compile it (i.g "g++ -o psc passwordStrengthChecker.cpp") if run in VS Code. Then you can run that executable that you made with "./psc".

Warning and Limitations: This program is just a simple checker based on characters used and how many. It does not check more complex details such as: repetition, real words, patterns, and whether your password is tied to other passwords. Therefore as you recieve your score for your password, you should note these things.
