# Password-Strength-Checker
Description: This contains a file that will recieve your input of a password. It then prints whether the following password is a strong password or not with helpful comments on how to improve it. Note: This program is for educational purposes only.
I advise against personal passwords.

Installation: This code needs a compiler in order for it to function and run properly. Note: if you are using VS Code then you can do this through the extensions. Once you get the compiler working, in the terminal you can compile it (i.g "g++ -o psc passwordStrengthChecker.cpp") if run in VS Code. Then you can run that executable that you made with "./psc". It will then ask you for a password, of which you can type in the terminal.

Warning and Limitations: This program is just a simple checker based on what characters used and how many. It does not check more complex details such as: repetition, whether it is a real word or not, patterns, and whether your password is tied to other passwords. Therefore as you recieve your score (weak, moderate, strong) for your password, you should note these things.

Misuse: Becuase this program doesn't check a full detailed account of your password, it can give a false sense of security. Note that this program is for education purposes and if used for actual implementation or real life production; be careful of weaknesses. I advise agaisnt storing passwords for security purposes.
